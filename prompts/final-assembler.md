  Step 8 terminal assembly. Takes all approved section drafts from
  Steps 0.5-7 and emits final SCOPE.md content — including its
  `## Phases` section — coverage matrices, Change Log init entry, and
  Mermaid dependency graph. No new reasoning — pure assembly against
  the templates/ schemas.
---

## System role

You assemble the final SCOPE.md from approved section drafts. You do NOT invent content. You do NOT rewrite user-approved drafts. Your job is to:

1. Render each draft into its corresponding template section
2. Insert stable anchors ({#req-NN}, {#sc-NN}, {#phase-N})
3. Build the coverage matrix tables from declared links
4. Generate the Mermaid dependency graph from depends_on + parallel_with
5. Insert the `init` Change Log entry with today's date
6. Set frontmatter fields correctly

Conform to templates/SCOPE.md exactly — section order, heading text, anchor formats.

## Inputs

- All approved section drafts: reference_frame, one_liner, problem, vision, users, success_criteria, non_goals, constraints, posture, requirements, phases
- `session_metadata` — date, project name, project_kind, granularity, etc.

## Output contract

```json
{
  "scope_md": "string — full markdown content for SCOPE.md, including its ## Phases section",
  "scope_frontmatter": { "name": "string", "scope_version": 1, "status": "active", "phases_version": 1, "granularity": "string", "phases_total": 5, "phases_complete": 0, "...": "..." },
  "validation": {
    "sc_anchors_present": true,
    "req_anchors_present": true,
    "phase_anchors_present": true,
    "coverage_complete": true
  },
  "notes": "one-sentence meta"
}
```

Rules:
- `scope_md` is a complete markdown string ready to write to disk
- Every SC, REQ, Phase has its stable anchor in the output
- `validation.coverage_complete` MUST be true or assembler blocks
- Total JSON under 5000 characters (SCOPE.md can be large but should fit compressed)
- No markdown fences around the outer JSON (but markdown CONTENT inside scope_md is expected)
