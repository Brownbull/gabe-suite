# Debt Pattern Catalog

Data-driven catalog consumed by `/gabe-health debt` (see `skills/gabe-health debt/SKILL.md`). Each `P<n>-*.md` file is a self-contained pattern definition. Patterns are evidence-anchored to real failures in Gastify (`docs/rebuild/LESSONS.md` R1–R13) and BoletApp (`docs/sprint-artifacts/epic-14c-retro-2026-01-20.md`). Not generic invention.

## File format

Every pattern file has the following sections. `gabe-health` (debt lens) parses them deterministically — keep headings stable.

```markdown
# P<n> — <pattern handle>

## Evidence source
<Retro / LESSONS file reference that seeds this pattern.>

## Red-line questions
Yes/no decisions that MUST be resolved. If any answer is "no / unknown / implicit," the pattern fires.
- ...

## Detection — doc pass
Structured inputs (.kdbp/* files) to read and what to look for.
- ...

## Detection — code pass
Grep / AST heuristics to run on the codebase.
- ...

## Detection — commit pass
Commit message markers that indicate the pattern was stepped-around instead of resolved.
- ...

## Tier impact
- MVP: <behavior at MVP tier — surfaces or suppresses>
- Enterprise: <behavior>
- Scale: <behavior>

## Severity default
CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM

## ADR stub template
<Pre-written Decision / Rationale / Alternatives to seed DECISIONS.md when user promotes to `d`.>

## Open Question template
<Pre-written question to seed SCOPE.md §14 when user promotes to `o`.>

## Rule template
<Pre-written R-entry body to seed RULES.md when user promotes to `r`.>
```

## Adding a custom pattern

Drop a new file at `.kdbp/debt-patterns/<id>-<handle>.md` in your project. Project-local patterns override globally-shipped ones by ID.
